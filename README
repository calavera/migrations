Migrations
==========

Run Rails migrations from Java.

Small utility to run Rails migrations from Java, inspired by Yoko's post on
how to package rubygems in a jar file:

http://yokolet.blogspot.com/2010/10/gems-in-jar-with-redbridge.html


Usage
=====

1. Put your Rails migrations under this directory:

  src/main/resources/db/migrate

2 Create the jar file:

  jruby -S rake migrations:bundle ant:jar

3 Run migrations:

  java -Dmigrations.db.name=DB_NAME -cp jruby-complete.jar:migrations-0.1.0.jar migrations.Migrate [OPTIONAL_VERSION_NUMBER]


Restrictions
============

Due to this already resolved bug this library only works with JRuby's trunk version:

  http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-5155


Todo

- It's not too much overengineered, let's do it!
